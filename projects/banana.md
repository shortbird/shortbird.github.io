# Banana sharing

## Instructions
Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input:

1. The number of people in the group
2. The total number of bananas

The program should split the bananas evenly among the group, leaving the remaining bananas out. It should also print the number of bananas each person gets and the total remaining.

## Example
**Input**
```
5   # number of people in the group
17  # number of bananas
```

**Output**
```
3   # how many bananas each person gets
2   # how many bananas are left in the basket
```
