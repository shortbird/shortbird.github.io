# Sorting Algorithms
Combine all six sorting algorithms into one program.

## Reference
* [Bubble sort](./bubble_sort.md)
* [Insertion sort](./insertion_sort.md)
* [Selection sort](./selection_sort.md)
* [Merge sort](./merge_sort.md)
* [Heap sort](./heap_sort.md)
* [Quick sort](./quick_sort.md)

## Instructions
Now that you've created functions for all six sorting algorithms, combine them all into one program. Your program should:
* Have a text-based menu that allows the user to choose which algorithm to use
* Print out the total time it took each algorithm to run
* Be able to run multiple times, so your program should not edit the `numbers.txt` file. It should output the result to a new file without changing the original data.
