# Morse Code Decoder

## Instructions
Write a program that decodes from Morse code to English. It should accept periods as the dots, and hyphens as the dash: ..-- .-

## Requirements
Your program should meet the following requirements:
* Use a Binary Search Tree (BST) to decode the Morse code.
* Be idiot-proof and easy to use.
* Take in a string of Morse code as input and output the decoded message.

## Hints
* The image below is a representation of a Binary Search Tree for Morse Code. A dot indicates a move to the left, and a dash indicates a move to the right.
