# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

## Instructions
**If this is your first time learning about object-oriented programming, [start here.](../strand_one/basic_oop.md)**

Now that you understand the basics of object-oriented programming it's time to learn about inheritance and composition. To start, go through this online [tutorial found here.](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

This tutorial walks you through the more advanced concepts of object-oriented programming. You'll start to see how UML diagrams work and why they're necessary to track complex programs.

Some key vocabulary terms to know:

**Inheritance** - Refers to an **is-a** relationship. For example, Jupiter *is a* planet. If you were to create a class called ``planet`` and a class called ``Jupiter``, the ``Jupiter`` class would *inherit* planet attributes from its parent class ``planet`` because it *is-a* planet.

**Composition** - Refers to a **has-a** relationship. For example, a person *has a* name. Inheritance does not work in this case, because a name is not a person, but a person *has-a* name.

After completing this advanced walkthrough, follow along with these three videos. You should be typing the code along with the video instructor. They build on the earlier series you completed in the basic object-oriented lesson

While you won't end up with a fully finished program, these videos contain all the information related to object-oriented programming you need to know for this class. Understanding these concepts will help you in future projects you'll need to complete.
