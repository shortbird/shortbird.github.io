# Basic Object-Oriented Programming

## Instructions
First, follow along with this [tutorial found here.](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

This tutorial walks you through the basics of object-oriented programming designed for complete beginners. It will instruct you to follow along in IDLE's interactive window. When you see `>>>` followed by code, this is what you should type into the Python shell.

After completing this basic walkthrough, follow along with these three videos. You should be typing the code along with the video instructor.
