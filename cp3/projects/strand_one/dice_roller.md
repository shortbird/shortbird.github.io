# Auto Dice Roller
Write a program that you can use to automate D&D dice rolls

## Instructions
Dungeons and Dragons is a popular role-playing game that uses different dice rolls to determine the outcome of certain events. Most D&D players need a set of seven dice to play the game. Your assignment is to write a Python program that automates this dice rolling process.

Write a Python program that:
* Has a working text-based menu to allow the user to select which dice to roll
* Has a unique function for each die (D4, D6, D8, D10, D00, D12, D20)
* Randomly outputs a number from the range of the dice chosen

## Hints

* If you're a big D&D fan, try adding functionality that rolls a dice a certain number of times, such as a "2D10 roll". You could also add in functionality to completely automate battles including the HP of each player, the dice they can roll, certain actions they can take, etc.
