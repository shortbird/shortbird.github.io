# Pig Latin Translator
Pig Latin is a language game that uses set rules to make normal English incomprehensible to those unaware of the language.

## Instructions
Write a Python program that:
* Translates an English input into Pig Latin
* Translates a Pig Latin input into English
* Has a working text-based menu to allow the user to select either option

## Hints
Here are the rules used by Pig Latin:
* If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add "yay" to the end
  * For example, "exit" is translated to "exityay"
* If a word begins with a consonant, remove all letters before the first vowel and add them to the end of the word, followed by "ay"
  * For example, "yeet" is translated to "eetyay"
