# Fibonacci Sequence
Write a program that uses recursion to print the Fibonacci sequence N numbers long.

## What is the Fibonacci sequence?
The [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a set of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. As the numbers increase they form the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), a pattern found regularly in nature.

## Instructions
Your assignment is to write a program that:
* Gets a user input of how many digits of the Fibonacci sequence to print
* Uses recursion to print out the sequence

## Hints
* See [this page](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/fibonacci-recursion) for a sample solution. **Do not copy/paste this solution.** Instead, use it as a reference as you write your own function.
