### Projects


## Strand 4
Students will properly employ dynamic data structures / abstract data types (ADTs)

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to use stacks in programs
* Declare stack structures
* Initialize stacks
* Check for empty and full stacks
* Push on to and pop off values from stacks
* Develop an application that uses stacks

### Projects

  * https://alpine.instructure.com/courses/56757/assignments/662575?module_item_id=1394626
  * Uses built-in Python data structures (list)


## Strand 5
Students will design and implement advanced object-oriented concepts

### Standard 1
Implement object-oriented programs
* Create classes with minimal extraneous relationships (high cohesion and low coupling)
* Demonstrate and use composition and aggregation (HAS-A) relationships
* Demonstrate the use of class variables (static variables)

### Standard 2
Implement inheritance in an object-oriented program
* Utilize class hierarchies (parent-child relationships)
* Demonstrate IS-A relationships
* Override methods and understand how to call the overriding method from the child
* Demonstrate the protected modifier
* Call a parent class constructor from the child's constructor

### Standard 3
Create and use abstract classes
* Create and implement abstract classes
* Implement interfaces (purely abstract classes)
* Know difference between abstract & interface classes

### Standard 4
Implement polymorphism
* Demonstrate that a parent object variable can hold an instance of a child class
* Determine IS-A relationships via code
* Demonstrate typecasting via method calls of inherited objects

### Projects

* Postfix to Infix, but students create their own Stack class
* Queues, but students create their own queue class

## Strand 6
Students will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design object-oriented programs

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the use of UML in design
* Create an activity diagram
* Create a class diagram for the class hierarchy of a program
* Create a sequence diagram for a function
* Translate diagrams to code

### Projects
* Create UML diagrams of past projects

## Strand 7
Students will develop a program of significant complexity as part of a portfolio

### Standard 1
Create an individual program of significant complexity (300-500 lines)
* Create design documentation for the project
* Follow accepted object-oriented programming methodology when writing the code

### Standard 2
Compile a portfolio of the individual and group programs developed
* Include sample design work
* Include sample program source code
