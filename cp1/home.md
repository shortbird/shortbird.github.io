# Programming 1

[Click here to view the Utah standards for this class](./documents/standards.md)

This is a project-based class. This means you learn through doing, rather than listening to a teacher. To get started you will complete the first five units on the website CodeHS.com. This will give you the introductory skills you need to start programming.

You can access the [CodeHS classroom here](https://codehs.com/go/21AB5). If it asks you for a class code, enter 21AB5.

When you finish these assignments in CodeHS you will use the remainder of the semester to work on your own project. You may also choose to work ahead on the Programming 2 assignments for next semester, but keep in mind that this will leave you extra time at the end of next semester to work on your own project.

If you have completed all the CodeHS assignments for this class and need ideas for projects you can work on, I have provided a list of many potential projects you could work on. Review this list and work on anything that looks interesting to you.

This is a list of programming projects and tutorials designed for students enrolled in Programming 1. They are divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced categories, relative to the expected skill level of beginning programming students.
