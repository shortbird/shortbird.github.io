# Programming 1
Projects that align with the [Utah standards for Programming 1](./documents/cp1_standards.pdf)

## Table of Contents:

* [Strand 1 - Using IDEs](##Strand-1)
* [Strand 2 - Program Development Methodology](##Strand-2)

* [Strand 4 - Control Structures and Loops](##Strand-4)
* [Strand 5 - Career Opportunities](##Strand-5)

## Strand 1
Students will be familiar with and use a programming language IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

### Standard 1
Demonstrate concept knowledge of different languages.
* Describe the difference between interpreted and compiled languages
* Identify characteristics of high-level and low-level languages

### Standard 2
Demonstrate the ability to use an IDE.
* Use an IDE to develop, compile, and run programs
* Understand the difference between syntax, run-time, and logic errors
* Use the debugger to identify errors

## Strand 2
Students will understand program development methodology

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to use good programming style
* Demonstrate proper use of white space (between lines and indentation)
* Use appropriate naming conventions for identifiers (variables, methods, functions, and file names)
* Construct identifiers with meaningful format; camelCase and under_score

### Standard 2
Understand the software development lifecycle
* Identify specifications and understand requirements to create a solution to a problem
* Develop a program using external documentation (flowcharts, abstracts, and pseudocode) to break down the problem into sub-components
* Design solutions using algorithms
* Test program for verification of errors and proper functionality
* Provide internal comments in the IDE that explain functionality through documentation
* Redo all steps as needed

### Standard 3
Identify the components of programming language syntax
* Understand keywords, identifiers, operators, and operands
* Understand statements and expressions in a program
* Understand program components such as functions, methods, or procedures

## Strand 3
Students will demonstrate effective use of commands and operations

### Standard 1
Employ basic use of elements and data types of a programming language
* Declare, initialize, and assign values to constants and variables
* Demonstrate the ability to use input and output commands
* Declare and use variable types (primitives, reference, or object)
* Identify proper data types for a specified application (boolean, int, float, point, str)

### Standard 2
Employ basic arithmetic expressions
* Use basic arithmetic operators (modulus, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)
* Understand order of operation of expressions
* Write expressions that mix float and int expressions

## Strand 4
Students will properly employ control and loop structures

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to use relational and logical operators in programs
* Compare values using relational operators (<, >, ==, <=, >=, etc.)
* Form complex expressions using logical operators

### Standard 2
Demonstrate the ability to use decisions in programs
* Employ simple if structures
* Use if-else and nested if-else structures

### Standard 3
Demonstrate the ability to use loops in programs
* Demonstrate knowledge between for loops, while loops, and do while loops
* Describe the various ways that loops can end (i.e. sentinel, break, condition fail, etc.)
* Design loops so they iterate the correct number of times (i.e. off-by-one errors, infinite loops, etc.)
* Utilize nested loops

## Strand 5
Students will be aware of career opportunities in the Computer Programming/Software Engineering industry and ethical applications

### Standard 1
Investigate career opportunities, trends, and requirements related to computer programming/software engineering careers
* Identify the members of a computer programming/software engineering team:
  * Team leader
  * Analyst
  * Senior developer
  * Junior developer
  * Client/subject matter expert
* Describe work performed by each member of the computer programming/software engineering team
* Investigate trends and traits associated with computer programming/software engineering careers
* Discuss related career pathways

### Standard 2
Have an understanding of current ethical issues dealing with computer programming and information in society
* Explain the impact software can have on society (i.e. privacy, piracy, copyright laws, etc.)
* Explain the ethical reasons for creating reliable and robust software
* Describe how computer-controlled automation affects a workplace and society
