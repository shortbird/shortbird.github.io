# Sloth Climbing

## Instructions
Write a program that takes three inputs - the number of feet a sloth climbs during the day, and the amount he slides down at night, and the total height he needs to climb. Print the number of days it takes the sloth to climb up the tree.
1. Feet he goes up during the day
2. Feet he slides down at night
3. Total height needed to climb (in feet)

## Example
**Input**
```
3     # feet up during the day
2     # feet down during the night
10    # total height needed to climb
```

**Output**
```
8     # days to reach needed height
```
